# Next.js Notion Starter Kit

> The perfect starter kit for building websites with Next.js and Notion.
## Intro

This repo is what I use to power my personal blog / portfolio site [Amyth.dev](https://amyth.dev).

It uses Notion as a CMS, fetching content from Notion and then uses [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [react-notion-x](https://github.com/NotionX/react-notion-x) to render everything.

The site is then deployed to [Vercel](http://vercel.com).
